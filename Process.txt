	- To start, purchase a domain with a legitimate ‘feeling’ domain name. 
	- Purchase an email address that is associated with the domain name. 
	
With the email, send several test emails to an email address you control. Ensure that the email address delivers mail that looks legitimate. For instance, ensure the ‘name’ is rendered correctly and is not simply a repeat of the email address. 
If your pretext requests the victim to click a hyperlink. 
	- Spin up a server (for example, an EC2 instance) to host the web application or page.
	- Register the server with the domain name, through whatever service you purchased the domain through. Alternatively, you can migrate the domain name and registration to cloudflare.
